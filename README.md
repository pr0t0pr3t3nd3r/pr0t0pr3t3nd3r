- 👋 Hi, I’m @pr0t0pr3t3nd3r, but i've been known as just Pr0t0 for about 30+ years
- 👀 I’ve always been interested in cybersecurty. Particularly, web security.
-    I have been "pentesting" since the early days of wardialing, seeing what exciting things were hiding in other systems such as BBSs.
- 🌱 I've been focused on other things for awhile, so i'm currently re-learning using resources such as:
     - pentesterlab.com
     - tryhackme.com
     - hackthebox.eu
- 💞️ I’m looking to start putting notes on what i've been learning, here on Github.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
     - here on Github
     - via email: pr0t0pr3t3nd3r at protonmail.ch
     - maybe Twitter, maybe not
